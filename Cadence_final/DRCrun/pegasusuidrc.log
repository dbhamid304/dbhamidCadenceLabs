WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream Out. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.
INFO (XSTRM-280): The output file will be a compressed file because the file name has extension .gz

If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the '-viaMap' option for preserving oaVia instances in a XStream Out - XStream In round trip.

WARNING (XSTRM-35): The objects in the layer-purpose pair 'edgeLayer:drawing' are ignored. This is because the layer-purpose pair used in the design is not specified in the layer map file. Specify the layer-purpose pair in the layer map file and try again.
